# PhysicsEngine

Program developed for a deeper understanding of physics simulation and collision detection in 2D.
A physics engine traditionally handles collisions and interactions between physical objects in a game, and this is exactly what was the initial purpose for developing this program.

The program handles collisions only between convex polygons which is a demonstration of the limitations of the collision detection scheme used, namely the separating axis theorem.
