SEPARATING AXIS THEOREM

Used for collision detection of convex objects. This is done by checking all the 
normals to each face in all the objects that potentially collide and determining 
if any axis penetrate. That is, if the objects vertices overlap any of the other 
object's vertices in the direction of a normal. All axis' must penetrate for a
collision to take place.

THE ALGORITHM

1) Find the normal vectors (pointing out from the center).

2) Determine if the vertex of one polygon located closest to the position of 
the other polygon penetrate any axis of the other polygon

3) If it penetrates all axis' of the other polygon a collision has taken place

PENETRATING AXIS

A point penetrates an axis if the distance between the closest vertices of the 
two objects along any axis is negative
