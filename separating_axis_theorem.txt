					---- SEPARATING AXIS THEOREM ----

Used for collision detection of convex objects. This is done by checking all the 
normals to each face in all the objects that potentially collide and determining 
if any axis penetrate. That is, if the distance between any of the vertices on 
the polygons involved in the collision projected along any of the normals are 
negative. All axis' must penetrate for a collision to take place.

						---- THE ALGORITHM ----

1) Find the normal vectors (pointing out from the center).

2) Loop through all the vertices on the polygons involved in the collision and
project the distance along any of the normals.

3) If it penetrates all axis' of the other polygon a collision has taken place.
If the distance projected along any one normal is positive, the collision detection
algorithm should terminate since no collision is possible

						---- PENETRATING AXIS ----

A point penetrates an axis if the distance between the closest vertices of the 
two objects along any axis is negative
