1) Find best edges of a and b
    The left/right vertex that is farthest along the collision axis for b
    and farthest along the negative collision axis for a. The left/right 
    is chosen according to whichever has the most perpendicular edge
    w.r.t. the collision axis

2) Do the clipping
    The objective here is to eliminate parts of the incident object
    such that one is left with a contact manifold that contains the
    contact points
